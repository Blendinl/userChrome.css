# Darknight

Darknight is a userChrome.css meant to make Firefox as _clean_ and  **non-distracting** as possible.

## Foreword
Largely based off [keyfox](https://github.com/AlfarexGuy2019/keyfox/). Hide your bookmarks bar and as much addons from the toolbar as possible for a clean layout. Do check out others' CSS like [cascade](https://github.com/andreasgrafen/cascade) for variants that collapses your addons into a menu. 
> **Do star this project if you like it!**

## Features
- OneLine Design
- Keyboard-centric
- Dark theme (True black colour)
- Addons are not obscured behind a menu

## Installation 
- Refer to FirefoxCSS's [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/wiki/index/tutorials/) to find out how to use userChrome.css themes.

## Common Essential Keybindings
- Close tabs by Ctrl+W
- Traverse forward/backwards into the tab's history by Alt+Arrow Keys
- Bookmark pages by right clicking the tab
