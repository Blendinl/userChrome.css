# Darknight ðŸ¦‡

Darknight is a userChrome.css meant to make Firefox as _clean_ and  **non-distracting** as possible.

## Foreword
Largely based off [keyfox](https://github.com/AlfarexGuy2019/keyfox/). Hide your bookmarks bar and as much addons from the toolbar as possible for a clean layout. Check out others' CSS like [cascade](https://github.com/andreasgrafen/cascade) that collapses your addons into a menu if you have tons of addons you need on your screen.
> **Do star this project if you like it!**

## Features
- OneLine Design
- Keyboard-centric
- Dark theme (True black colour)
- Addons are not obscured behind a menu

  Looks extremely boring, and meant to be so.

  Unobtrusive highlighting of active tab.
