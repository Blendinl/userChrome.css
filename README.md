# Darknight

Darknight is meant to make Firefox as _clean_ and  **non-distracting** as possible. 

## Foreword
Largely based on [keyfox](https://github.com/AlfarexGuy2019/keyfox/). Intended usecase is to hide as much addons from the toolbar as possible for a clean layout. Do check out others' CSS like [cascade](https://github.com/andreasgrafen/cascade) for a variant that collapses your addons into a menu. Do star this project if you like it!
